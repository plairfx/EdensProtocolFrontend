## Eden's Protocol Frontend

This is the frontend of Eden’s Protocol which makes the front of the privacy protocol,


Which uses multiple scripts to generate commitment and create a merkleTree to help verify the Zero Knowledge Proof.

Note: The deployed website on finaledp.vercel.app has not a working withdraw function as i had problems collecting the commitments to mimic the merkleTree for the proof verification.
Local hosted project will work so you can actually withdraw correctly! with the rindexer getting the commitments and them being used to verify the proof.
